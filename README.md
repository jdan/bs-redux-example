This is an experiment in writing [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) reducers for a React app in OCaml with [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript).

I'm using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) to run the React app because it's a very handy project.

### Run it

```
npm i
npm run build
npm run start
```
